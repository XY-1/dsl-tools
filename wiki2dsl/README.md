This project contains several scripts that can be used with tab-separated monolingual and bilingual dictionary files generated by [wikidata-parse.rb](https://github.com/dohliam/wikidata-parse) to create compressed DSL-format dictionaries for use in offline dictionary programs (such as [GoldenDict](http://goldendict.org/) or [gdcl](https://github.com/dohliam/gdcl)).

A [repository](https://github.com/open-dsl-dict/wikidata-dict) containing pre-compiled dictionaries for dozens of languages is available as part of the [Open DSL Dictionary Project](https://github.com/open-dsl-dict).

# Supported languages

Any language that has an existing Wikipedia project is supported, which includes all the languages on [this list](https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/List_of_Wikipedias).

# Downloading dictionaries

Pre-compiled versions of the bilingual Wikipedia dictionaries created using this script can be found in the [wikidata-dict](https://github.com/open-dsl-dict/wikidata-dict) repo.
